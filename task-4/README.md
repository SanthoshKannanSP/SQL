# Task-4 - Multi-Table JOINs

## Objective
- Combine data from two related tables using JOIN operations.

## Requirements
- Create two related tables (e.g., `Customers` and `Orders`) with a foreign key relationship.
- Write an `INNER JOIN` query to retrieve combined information (e.g., customer names along with their order details).
- Experiment with other types of joins such as `LEFT JOIN` to understand how missing matches are handled.

## To run commands
```
psql -U <username> -d <database> -f commands.sql -W
```
