# Task-2 - Basic Filtering and Sorting

## Objectives
- Write queries that filter records and sort the result set.

## Requirements
- Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on a condition (e.g., `WHERE Department = 'Sales'`).
- Apply the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results (e.g., by `LastName` or `Salary`).
- Experiment with multiple conditions using `AND`/`OR`.

## To run commands
```
psql -U <username> -d <database> -f commands.sql -W
```
